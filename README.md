# Res0luti0n
RES0LUTI0N is a RAT injector not detected by antivirus software coded in python and C#. It uses a randomized obfuscation system, a RAT partitioning system and a recompilation system at the same time. It is designed to bypass mainly Windows Defender and therefore has not been tested with other antivirus programs.
