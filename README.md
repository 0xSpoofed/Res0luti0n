# RES0LUTI0N

RES0LUTI0N is a RAT injector not detected by antivirus software coded in python and C#. It uses a randomized obfuscation system, a RAT partitioning system and a recompilation system at the same time. It is designed to bypass mainly Windows Defender
## Features

- **Undetected by Virustotal**
- **Windows defender disabler**
- **Can inject any python code, it will of course be made undetectable**
- **Easy to use**
- **Quick use**

## Requirements
- **Windows 7/8/10/11** OS only (*win32, for x86, x86_64, and arm64 architectures*)
- **Python 3.x** (*python 3.9 used for the project.*)
- **Modules:** (*pywin32, requests*)

## Usage
### 1. First step

Start by installing the modules by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

*↦Troubleshooting: If an error occurs, check that you are using a version of python equal or lower than 3.9.x as this may cause errors or use `pip pip install --upgrade pip`*

### 2. Second step

Now run the program with python by clicking on it or by using the command :
```console
python Res0luti0n.py
```
*↦Troubleshooting: Check that the modules are installed correctly, that you are using the right operating system and that your python works properly*

### 3. Third step

1) Change the settings by pressing `2` and `enter`:

2) Select Choose the number you want to change the setting you want:
*↦Hint: Start with the webhook which is the most important for the proper functioning of the program*

### 4. Last step
Press `4` if you are already in the parameter menu, otherwise just press `1` to build your RAT. 
*↦Troubleshooting: If this does not work, check that you have entered the correct parameters (like a correct size for shoes)*

### 5. Usage
For the proper functioning of the injector it is imperative that the entirety of what is in the ZIP created is located in the same directory. Of course, the folder containing the logos and the injector itself is deleted after being executed

*↦Hint: I recommend you to use it as a module in a python script, it allows to trivialize it and to hide it*
